# Prerequisites

## Goal

* Install all the tools needed for Holographic development

This workshop requires a few resources before we get going:

## Tools

Instructions available on the [Windows Holographic](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/install_the_tools) section of the Dev Center - they're better than my summary here.

But if you're lazy:

* [Visual Studio 2015 Update 3](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads) or later (say, VS2017)
  * Windows 10 SDK (latest) - install them all to be safe
  * Unity Tools for Visual Studio are installed
  * (VS2015 only) Ensure Tools 1.4 are installed
* [HoloLens Emulator](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=823018)
  * If you don't have VS2015 Update 3 installed, you will need a reg hack to pass the prerequisites.
* Latest [Unity 5.6.0f3](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal) - comes with Holographic support.
  * If installing frmo offline installer, make sure you include the standard assets and Metro Support for UWP goodness

## Configuration - Emulator

* Ensure HyperV is enabled
* If you are using VS2017, you will need a reg hack to install the emulator - see the link above for details
