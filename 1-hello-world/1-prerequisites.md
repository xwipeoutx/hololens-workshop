# Prerequisites

## Goal

* Install all the tools needed for Holographic development

This workshop requires a few resources before we get going:

## Tools

Instructions available on the [Windows Holographic](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/install_the_tools) section of the Dev Center - they're better than my summary here.

But if you're lazy:

* [Visual Studio 2015 Update 3](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads) or later
  * Ensure Windows 10 SDK (latest) is installed
  * Ensure Unity Tools for Visual Studio are installed
* [HoloLens Emulator](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=823018)
  * If you don't have VS2015 Update 3 installed, you will need a reg hack to pass the prerequisites.
* Latest [Unity 5.6.1f1 or later](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal) - comes with Holographic support.

## Configuration - Emulator

* Ensure HyperV is enabled
* If you are using VS2017, you will need a reg hack to install the emulator - see the link above for details
