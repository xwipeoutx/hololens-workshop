In this part we will see how HoloLens becomes aware of your surroundings, and learn how objects can interact with it.

## Goals

* Read the spatial mesh of a room
* Use a fake room for use within Unity
* Make our cube fall to the ground
* Highlight the planes within our room
* Understand what on earth is going on with all this jazz
